Renaming pgdac to panoply
- Branched off of issue-versioning
- Replaced pgdac to panoply in the following:
  * tasks/pgdac_*
  * tasks/pgdac_*/pgdac_*
  * tasks/pgdac_*/pgdac_*.wdl
- Removed the following files from the tasks folder:
  * Dockerfile (pgdac_common): redundant
  * map.txt
  * targets/
  * configs/
- Recreating Dockers, WDLs, and Terra Workflows with new semantic versioning will
  create new map.txt, targets/, and configs/ (upcoming)
- rebrand.sh (the script that does all the above)
- META: this commit message
